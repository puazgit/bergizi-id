## 🔧 Core Business Logic Implemented

### 1. Employee Service (`employeeService.ts`)
**Comprehensive employee lifecycle management:**

#### Key Features:
- ✅ Employee creation with full validation
- ✅ Employee search & filtering by department
- ✅ Promotion workflow with automatic updates
- ✅ Termination handling with proper records
- ✅ HRD metrics calculation (total employees, departments, etc.)
- ✅ Multi-tenant support with SPPG isolation

#### Business Rules:
```typescript
// Employee creation requires complete validation
const validated = employeeSchema.safeParse(input)

// SPPG isolation for security
const employees = await this.employeeRepository.findBySppgId(sppgId)

// Promotion workflow with business logic
const promotion = await this.promoteEmployee(employeeId, newPosition, effectiveDate)
```

### 2. Attendance Calculator (`attendanceCalculator.ts`)
**Advanced attendance tracking and analytics:**

#### Key Features:
- ✅ Working hours calculation with break time handling
- ✅ Attendance status determination (PRESENT, LATE, ABSENT, etc.)
- ✅ Monthly attendance summary generation
- ✅ Overtime calculation algorithms
- ✅ Attendance rate calculation for performance reviews

#### Calculation Logic:
```typescript
// Working hours calculation
const workingHours = this.calculateWorkingHours(clockIn, clockOut, breakStart, breakEnd)

// Attendance status logic
const status = this.determineAttendanceStatus(clockIn, scheduledStart, tolerance)

// Monthly metrics
const summary = await this.calculateMonthlySummary(employeeId, year, month)
```

### 3. Performance Tracker (`performanceTracker.ts`)
**Sophisticated performance review management:**

#### Key Features:
- ✅ Performance rating calculations across multiple dimensions
- ✅ Trend analysis for performance improvement tracking
- ✅ Action item generation based on performance gaps
- ✅ Goal achievement tracking and recommendations
- ✅ Career development path suggestions

#### Performance Analytics:
```typescript
// Multi-dimensional rating calculation
const overallRating = this.calculateOverallRating(skillRatings)

// Performance trend analysis
const trend = this.analyzePerformanceTrend(pastReviews)

// Development recommendations
const recommendations = this.generateDevelopmentRecommendations(strengths, improvements)
```

### 4. Training Service (`trainingService.ts`)
**Complete training program management:**

#### Key Features:
- ✅ Training program creation and management
- ✅ Employee enrollment with capacity management
- ✅ Training completion tracking with scores
- ✅ Training metrics and analytics
- ✅ Participant feedback and rating system
- ✅ Training effectiveness measurement

---

## 🗄️ Data Access Layer

### 1. Employee Repository (`employeeRepository.ts`)
**Type-safe employee data operations:**

#### Features:
- ✅ Full CRUD operations with Prisma integration
- ✅ Advanced search with department & position filtering
- ✅ Employee hierarchy support (supervisor relationships)
- ✅ Type-safe mapping from Prisma models to domain types
- ✅ Multi-tenant security with SPPG filtering

### 2. Attendance Repository (`attendanceRepository.ts`)
**Attendance data management:**

#### Features:
- ✅ Date range queries for attendance records
- ✅ SPPG-wide attendance reporting
- ✅ Employee-specific attendance history
- ✅ Attendance status updates and approvals

### 3. Training Repository (`trainingRepository.ts`)
**Training data operations:**

#### Features:
- ✅ Training program lifecycle management
- ✅ Employee enrollment tracking
- ✅ Participant completion status
- ✅ Training metrics aggregation

### 4. Performance Review Repository (`performanceReviewRepository.ts`)
**Performance review data access:**

#### Features:
- ✅ Review cycle management
- ✅ Employee review history
- ✅ Performance metrics storage
- ✅ Review status workflow tracking

---

## ✅ Input Validation Layer

### HRD Schema (`hrdSchema.ts`)
**Comprehensive validation with business rules:**

#### Employee Validation:
```typescript
export const employeeSchema = z.object({
  fullName: z.string().min(2, 'Nama lengkap minimal 2 karakter'),
  nik: z.string().length(16, 'NIK harus 16 digit'),
  email: z.string().email('Format email tidak valid'),
  phone: z.string().regex(/^[0-9+\-\s()]+$/, 'Format nomor telepon tidak valid'),
  dateOfBirth: z.date().refine(date => {
    const age = new Date().getFullYear() - date.getFullYear()
    return age >= 17 && age <= 65
  }, 'Usia harus antara 17-65 tahun')
})
```

#### Attendance Validation:
```typescript
export const attendanceSchema = z.object({
  attendanceDate: z.date(),
  clockIn: z.date().optional(),
  clockOut: z.date().optional(),
  status: z.enum(['PRESENT', 'LATE', 'ABSENT', 'HALF_DAY', 'OVERTIME', 'SICK_LEAVE', 'ANNUAL_LEAVE'])
})
```

## 🔐 Security Implementation

### Multi-Tenant Security:
```typescript
// Every query must include SPPG filtering
const employees = await db.employee.findMany({
  where: {
    sppgId: session.user.sppgId  // MANDATORY!
  }
})

// Repository level security
async findBySppgId(sppgId: string): Promise<Employee[]> {
  return this.db.employee.findMany({
    where: { sppgId }
  })
}
```

### Type Safety:
```typescript
// Strict type assertions prevent runtime errors
private mapPrismaToEmployee(prismaEmployee: Record<string, unknown>): Employee {
  return {
    id: prismaEmployee.id as string,
    sppgId: prismaEmployee.sppgId as string,
    fullName: prismaEmployee.fullName as string
    // ... all fields properly typed
  }
}
```

## 📈 Business Metrics & Analytics

### HRD Dashboard Capabilities:
1. **Employee Metrics**: Total employees, active count, department distribution
2. **Attendance Analytics**: Attendance rates, absenteeism patterns, overtime tracking
3. **Performance Insights**: Performance distribution, improvement trends, goal achievement
4. **Training Analytics**: Training completion rates, effectiveness metrics, skill development

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
```typescript
interface HRDMetrics {
  totalEmployees: number
  activeEmployees: number
  departmentDistribution: DepartmentStats[]
  averageAttendanceRate: number
  trainingCompletionRate: number
  averagePerformanceScore: number
  employeeTurnoverRate: number
}
```
