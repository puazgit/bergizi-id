## üöÄ NEXT STEPS IN COOLIFY

### Step 1: Update Environment Variables

Go to **Coolify Dashboard > Applications > bergizi-id > Environment Variables** and set:

```env
NODE_ENV=production
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://bagizi.id
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=[generate with: openssl rand -base64 32]
DATABASE_URL=[copy from Coolify PostgreSQL service]
```

### Step 2: Generate Secure Secret

Run in your terminal:
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

Copy the output and use it as `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` value.

### Step 3: Get Database URL

1. Go to **Coolify > Services > PostgreSQL**
2. Copy the connection string
3. Format as: `postgresql://user:password@host:port/database`

### Step 4: Redeploy Application

After setting environment variables:
1. Click **Deploy** in Coolify dashboard
2. Wait for deployment to complete
3. Check logs for any errors

### Step 5: Verify Setup

After redeployment, you can test using the scripts:

```bash
# Quick health check
node scripts/health-check.mjs

# Detailed debugging if needed
node scripts/debug-auth.mjs

# Full production validation
node scripts/validate-auth-production.mjs
```

## üéØ WHAT THIS FIXES

### ‚ùå Previous Issues

- `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'userRole')`
- `Auth.js ClientFetchError: There was a problem with the server configuration`
- Auth callbacks not working in Coolify environment
- Session management failures in production

### ‚úÖ Now Fixed

- **Safe middleware** with null checking for `session?.user?.userRole`
- **trustHost: true** enables Auth.js to work with Coolify's reverse proxy
- **Production-ready cookies** with secure settings
- **Comprehensive error logging** for debugging
- **Environment validation** to catch configuration issues

## üîç TESTING AUTHENTICATION

After deploying, test the login flow:

1. **Visit**: https://bagizi.id/login
2. **Try logging in** with seeded user credentials
3. **Check application logs** in Coolify for any Auth errors
4. **Run health check**: `node scripts/health-check.mjs`

## üÜò TROUBLESHOOTING

If you still experience issues:

1. **Check Environment Variables**: Ensure all required vars are set correctly
2. **Review Logs**: Look at application logs in Coolify dashboard  
3. **Run Debug Script**: `node scripts/debug-auth.mjs` for detailed diagnostics
4. **Verify Database**: Ensure PostgreSQL service is running and accessible
5. **Check Domain**: Confirm https://bagizi.id is properly configured
